# Reflection
 Creating a web portfolio on GitHub was both a rewarding and challenging experience. One of the main challenges I faced was understanding how to effectively integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into the GitHub Pages platform. While GitHub Pages provides a free and accessible way to host websites, I initially struggled with the deployment process. The learning curve for configuring the repository to display the website properly was steep. To solve this, I went through tutorials and referred to the GitHub documentation multiple times. I also leveraged community forums and stack overflow for troubleshooting specific issues with custom domains and CSS styling.

Another challenge was ensuring the portfolio was responsive and looked good across different devices. Despite using basic responsive design techniques with media queries, I had to adjust certain elements, such as images and navigation menus, multiple times to make the layout more fluid. Testing the portfolio across different screen sizes and browsers helped identify these issues, and I refined my CSS accordingly.

In terms of improvements, I would enhance the portfolio by incorporating more interactive features, such as a light/dark theme toggle or a filterable project gallery. This would not only make the portfolio more engaging but also showcase my skills with JavaScript and user experience design. Additionally, I’d focus on optimizing the website’s loading speed by compressing images and reducing unnecessary files, which would improve the overall performance and accessibility. Finally, a more polished design with a consistent color scheme and typography would make the portfolio look more professional.
